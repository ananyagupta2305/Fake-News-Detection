# Fake-News-Detection
**Overview**
This project addresses the pressing issue of fake news proliferation in today's digital landscape. Leveraging machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP), the system aims to accurately identify and classify news articles as either real or fake. By providing a comprehensive approach to fake news detection, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and promote media literacy.

**Key Features**
**Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes various classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify news articles.
**NLP Techniques:** Implements NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and vectorization to analyze and preprocess text data.
**Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle, specifically curated for fake news detection.
**Evaluation Metrics:** Employs standard evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the detection models.
**Comparative Analysis:** Provides a comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for fake news detection.

**Results**
**SVM with TF-IDF:** Achieves the highest accuracy of 99% in detecting fake news.
**Comparative Analysis:** Provides insights into the performance of other algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN.
**Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion matrices and evaluation metrics offer a comprehensive assessment of model performance and effectiveness.

**Requirements**
Python: Version 3.6 or higher
**Python Packages**
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library
numpy: Numerical computing library
matplotlib: Data visualization library
